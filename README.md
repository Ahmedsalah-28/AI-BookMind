# 💬 AI/ML Books RAG Chat Assistant

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot for AI, Machine Learning, and LLM books.  
This project allows you to ask questions about content in your PDFs and get **accurate answers based on the documents**.

---

## 📚 Books Included

- `0406_Software_Engineering_for_Data_Scientists`  
- `Hands-On Large Language Models Language Understanding and Generation`  

⚠️ Note:  
The book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (2nd Edition) by Aurelien Geron* was not uploaded due to its large file size.  
If you want to use it, you can manually add it to the `data/` folder before building the FAISS index.  

👉 You can also **add any other books you want** to the `data/` folder, and the assistant will automatically process them.

## ⚡ Features

- Extracts text from PDFs and splits it into chunks for better retrieval.  
- Embeds text using **sentence-transformers** for semantic search.  
- Builds a **FAISS vector index** for fast similarity search.  
- Integrates **RAG pipeline with memory** for conversational context.  
- Answers questions **only based on provided content**, with source references.  
- Streamlit web interface for easy interaction.
